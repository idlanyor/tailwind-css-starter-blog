Hello! My name is `Roynaldi`, and I am a third-semester student at `STMIK Widya Utama Purwokerto`. I am a Tech enthusiast with a strong interest in various technology fields. Currently, I have intermediate-level skills in web development, mobile development, and beginner-level skills in desktop programming. I am also actively interested in learning and staying updated on the latest technologies emerging in the world.

I often spend my free time pursuing my primary hobby, which is coding. I find great joy in creating something new and functional through programming languages. This hobby helps me continuously sharpen my software development skills.

In addition to being a student, I work at `Wisesa Cell & Copier in Karangreja`. There, I have a dual role as a `Graphic Designer` and a `Store Employee`. This allows me to combine my creativity with technology to create visually appealing and effective designs.

I am always open to learning and growing in the field of technology. With my enthusiasm and dedication, I believe I can continue to contribute to the creation of innovative and useful technological solutions for the world. Thank you for getting to know me!
